Topic;Question;Answer
Cloud;What is cloud native?;Cloud native refers to an approach where applications are built and deployed using cloud technologies, such as containers and microservices, and designed to be scalable, resilient, and flexible.
Cloud;What are the benefits of cloud computing?;Cloud computing offers benefits like scalability, cost-efficiency, flexibility, and accessibility, allowing organizations to easily deploy and manage applications and services.
Cloud;What is containerization?;Containerization is a method of running applications in isolated environments called containers. It provides a lightweight, portable, and consistent runtime environment for applications.
Cloud;What is orchestration in cloud computing?;Orchestration in cloud computing refers to the automated management and coordination of multiple containers or services, including provisioning, scaling, and deployment, to ensure the desired application state.
Cloud;What are some popular cloud service providers?;Some popular cloud service providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and IBM Cloud.
RAN;What is Cloud RAN?;Cloud RAN (Radio Access Network) is an architecture that virtualizes and centralizes baseband processing functions of cellular networks, enabling more flexible and efficient deployment and management.
RAN;What is the split architecture in Cloud RAN?;The split architecture in Cloud RAN separates the baseband processing functions into centralized units (CU) and distributed units (DU) to improve scalability, resource allocation, and network performance.
RAN;What are the benefits of Cloud RAN?;Cloud RAN offers benefits such as increased network capacity, lower operational costs, improved energy efficiency, and easier deployment and management of network functions.
RAN;What are the key considerations for Cloud RAN security?;Key considerations for Cloud RAN security include protecting the virtualized infrastructure, securing data transmission, implementing access controls, and addressing potential vulnerabilities in the network.
RAN;What is Cloud RAN lifecycle management?;Cloud RAN lifecycle management involves tasks such as deployment, configuration, monitoring, optimization, and maintenance of Cloud RAN infrastructure and its components.
Containers/Orchestration;What is the difference between containers and virtual machines?;Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that share the host operating system, while virtual machines are complete, emulated computer systems with their own operating systems.
Containers/Orchestration;What is Docker?;Docker is an open-source platform that enables containerization and provides tools for building, distributing, and running containers.
Containers/Orchestration;What is Kubernetes?;Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Containers/Orchestration;What is a microservice architecture?;Microservice architecture is an approach where an application is built as a collection of small, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
Containers/Orchestration;What is service discovery in container orchestration?;Service discovery in container orchestration refers to the mechanism that allows containers or services to locate and communicate with each other within a cluster, enabling seamless connectivity and load balancing.
